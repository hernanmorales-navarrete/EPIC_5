# The Dorothy Coding Challenge 2025

## Instructions for competitors:

This year's edition of the Dorothy Coding Challenge will have 3 stages. Stages 1 and 2 are qualifying (online) stages and Stage 3 is the final (in person) stage in Quito (UIDE Campus).

## Stage 1 (7 May - 6 June 2025):

Please read the following instructions very carefully:

1. Teams should submit their solutions to the proposed challenge by Sunday 11 May 2025 (23h59, UTC-5h) via this link: https://forms.gle/bmvUYeACiE9igb4T7

2. Late submissions won't be accepted nor considered for evaluation, so make sure you submit your solutions on time.

3. Submissions are accepted only in .ipynb format submitted via the link provided above.

4. Your ipython notebooks should be anonymous. No reference to your names, institutions, team names, etc. should be included in your notebook files. This will ensure that the evaluation of your codes by the panel of experts is fully blind. Upon submission, the logistics team will assign a random number to each submission before sending the codes for peer review. Failure to anonymise your submissions will result in automatic disqualification.

5. The evaluation process for Stage 1 will be conducted by a panel of experts, whose scores will be averaged at the end to determine the groups that continue to Stage 2. Teams with >70% qualify for the Stage 2.
  
6. The scores of Stage 1 will also have some weight in the overall score for those groups that reach the final stage, so please do your best.

## Programming challenge:

The selected teams will have to solve 1 programming challenge (all in Python version 3.x). Please see the proposed problems below:

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness (30%): The code produces the expected and correct outputs. The code solves the given problem.
- Implementation (30%): The code follows professional programming practices and is logically organised. 
- Sophistication (30%): The code successfully identifies and addresses key constraints.
- Coherence (10%): The code is efficient, fast and highly comprehensible.
