# Stage 2 (5 June - 6 July 2025):

Please read the following instructions very carefully:

1. Teams should submit their solutions to the proposed challenge by **Sunday 6 July 2025 (23h59, UTC-5h)** via this link: https://forms.gle/V9jq1qRPwKdrZmP87

2. Late submissions won't be accepted nor considered for evaluation, so make sure you submit your solutions on time.

3. Submissions are accepted only in the formats indicates in the instructions of each challenge.

4. Your submissions should be anonymous. No reference to your names, institutions, team names, etc. should be included in the submitted files. This will ensure that the evaluation of your codes by the panel of experts is fully blind. Upon submission, the logistics team will assign a random number to each submission before sending the codes for peer review. Failure to anonymise your submissions will result in automatic disqualification.

5. The evaluation process for Stage 2 will be conducted by a panel of experts, whose scores will be averaged at the end to determine the groups that qualify for the final round in EPIC 5. **Only 10 teams will qualify to the final in Quito.**
  
6. The scores of Stage 2 will have some weight in the overall score for those groups that reach the final stage, so please do your best.

## Programming challenges:

The selected teams will have to solve 2 programming challenges (all in Python version 3.x). Please see the proposed problems below:
